#### What could you expect from this talk?

* A little bit of history on containers
* Brief introduction about our infrastructure
 * of cource not on each detail
* Different ways of deploying software

---

What is a container?

![Container](img/containers.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/sewm/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

Simplified: Each container gets its own runtime environment, but all share the same kernel.

---

With the advantage of just running one kernel.

Note:

No additional overhead by VM kernels

---

But the disadvantage of just running one kernel.

---

Same kernel version for all the containers.

---

It is not possible to load different modules for containers.

---

OS type in containers must be the same like the host.

(Which is not true any more!)

---

The most simple way of containering is a traditional chroot environment. Introduced in 1979.

---

Which isolates runtime environments, but does not isolate process space and devices, and does nothing with resource control.

---

In 2000, FreeBSD jails were introduced. chroot was extended further isolation mechanisms, like process namespaces. Processes in one jail can only see processes in the same jail.

Note:

There are more isolations like prohibition of creating device nodes, mounts and so on.

---

In this time, Virtuozzo started with containers on Linux.

---

My first contact with containers was around 2007

![First Contact](img/first_contact.png)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_First_Contact#/media/File:Star_Trek_08-poster.png<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

Containers as in "more than just chroot"

---

When I worked in the Tivoli Storage Manager Team at IBM, where we had to support AIX WPARs and Solaris Zones.

Note:

WPAR = Workload Partition

---

The ideas are still the same, also in the times of Application Containers.

* Using the same kernel.
* Isolate environments as strong as possible.

---

### Why did containers get this traction in the past few years?

---

I think, it the easy way to create and deploy images.

![Images](img/images.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/smemon/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

We can run the image (almost) everywhere!

Note:

* No matter what: Baremetal, AWS, OpenStack, Google Cloud Engine, you name it.
* Except of our legacy platform tue to technical restrictions.
* In new versions of Virtuozzo this would work fine too.

--

… in a chroot without isolation and resource control using rkt fly by CoreOS

--

… in a small KVM (with an injected kernel), again using rkt, thanks to CoreOS and Intel

--

… on FreeBSD using JetPack

--

… even on Windows!

---

And all this *without* any modification to the image!

---

It changed the way we think about software.

---

### But there will be dragons!

![Dragon](img/dragon.jpg)

--

Unfortunately it is also very easy to build crappy images!!

![Broken](img/broken.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/57402879@N00/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

--

In my experience, deployments fail more likely because of misconfigured next-hops (like DB), instead of crappy software.

Note:

* Anyway. You now can test it over and over again.

--

Plugging services together is even more difficult in a floating environment.

Note:

* Things like Service Discovery are far out of scope here.

--

More management software is needed!

--

I strongly encourage you to read on this.

"Microservices: because solving business problems is hard but building loosely coupled fault-tolerant distributed systems is easy."

---

### So… What are you guys at SysEleven doing?

---

### Running two types of infrastructure!

---

### A new one, based on OpenStack…

![OpenStack](img/Cloud_OpenCloud_Chillin.png)

---

### … an old one, based on Parallels Virtuozzo…

![Virtuozzo](img/virtuozzo.jpg)

Note:

Which basically provides integration into OpenStack these days

---

… but most important: Provide, maintain and monitor the infrastructure into which our customers can deploy their code into.

![Managed](img/managed.png)

Note:

* monitoring as in: doing 24x7 for our customers

---

### On two levels!

---

The hardware and hypervisor "layer".

---

And the running Virtual Environments or Machines.

---

### Let's step into the virtuozzo platform

---

In the past, Virtuozzo was basically

* image format
* local storage
* network isolation
* Linux based container runtime
 * (but maintained outside of mainline)

Note:

around 2008

Which is still true, but there is more

---

… treating containers like usual virtual machines

* with a complete Linux running inside
 * sure, except of the kernel

Note:

Your targeted distribution has to be supported

---

But with a huge performance benefit over VMs

![Performance](img/performance.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/17612257@N00/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

### Some more history

![History](img/history.png)

---

From the early days, we have decent trending and alerting for all the services the customer provides.

Note:

nagios + zabbix for monitoring

---

We even built a web frontend, which gathered data from multiple nagios instances to give us a single overview.

![sNagios](img/nagios.png)

Note:

We run to many things to monitor for a single instance, running on a 24 Core XEON with 94GB RAM

---

Over time, we built billing, a local DNS-API, SSL-Cert "shop", some own metering-endpoints, Backups…

---

… we even developed some tools, to spawn new containers with a minimum set of needed configuration…

![Robot](img/robot.jpg)

---

… with a recommend system to return the best Hardware for the requested container.

![Recommend](img/recommend.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/jm3/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

But we still totally lack a customer facing API.

![Public](img/public.jpg)

---

Everything works via phone and ticketing system.

![Voice activated Admin](img/telefon.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/nekudo/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

Voice Activated Admin

Because of this we decided use OpenStack

---

### At some point, Configuration Management became cool

![Puppet](img/puppet.png)

Note:

… and we added a Puppet Master to our infrastructure, and registered all the containers to it. Based on this, we automated much stuff, like provisioning of basic stuff to the container and registering services to the monitoring.

---

But we still treat the containers like computers.

Note:

* more litally

---

![Giraf](img/giraf.jpg)

Note:

* like cute baby girafs

---

### These days we are running

![listvps](img/listvps.png)

Note:

about 3000 of those containers

on about 300 physical machines

---

### A traditional setup is still

* MySQL master slave setup
* Admin server
* a bunch of App server
* maybe some kind of search engine

---

We start the containers, using out internal toolchain.

---

This also triggers puppet to install required software in the container, setting up configuration and register them to our monitoring.

---

We hand over *exactly* this fully managed and running container to the customer.

![Fully managed container](img/managed-container.jpg)
https://www.flickr.com/photos/lindzgraham/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

Not any kind of image

---

Customers deploy their software to the admin server. From there it will be rsynced to the app server.

![Deploy](img/deploy.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/auxesis/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

All this worked very well for a long period of time!

---

But is very inflexible!

---

Installation of containers is strongly coupled to our infrastructure.

---

So changes to the infra hurt.

---

We have startup dependencies rather than build dependencies.

Note:

Many of them

---

Don't get me wrong!

---

You can build such problems in the shiny new container world as well!

Note:

so take care!

---

Often a new container is just a clone of an old one!

![Clone](img/clone.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/arenamontanus/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

With things like host name and monitoring stuff changed

---

There is

![Data](img/data.jpg)

in it.

https://www.flickr.com/photos/trevorandmarjee/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

At least the entire deployment is not very repeatable.

---

So we keep the containers alive, no matter what happens. In the worst case, we clone one back from the nightly backup.

Note:

Like you might expect. We have to backup the entire container.

---

Updates have to go to all containers…

![Updates](img/updates.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/bovinity/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

… rather than building one new image and replace old containers.

![Replace Container](img/old-container.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicowa/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

Again, with only build dependencies

---

Because customers software is not packaged in any way…

Note:

It is not easy to verify the installation

---

… there is no overview of the versions of the deployed software.

---

Rollbacks to a defined set of installed software and deployed software are nearly impossible.

![Rollback](img/rollback.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/thejesse/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

For sure, everything is possible. Some thing just cause more pain.

Just to name a few

---

Anyway.

This worked fine for a very long time…

---

But these days we need a public facing API

---

We didn't have the man power to develop our own.

---

And we didn't want to build an proprietary

![Island](img/island.jpg)

*again*!

https://www.flickr.com/photos/simuh/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

So we came up with OpenStack, and created…

---

![Sys11Stack](img/sys11stack.png)

Note:

Which is an latest OpenStack Mitaka

But changed components for storage and networking

And a bunch of automation to bootstrap

---

We run managed setups in SysEleven Stack.

---

Some customers choose to run production fully managed, and dev on self managed instances.

---

The core concept of running the managed setups is pretty much the same as before.

![Concept](img/concept.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/yoroy/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

But with lessons learned from the old platform!

![Feature](img/feature.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/pictoquotes/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

---

The setups are flexible, and we can also run them on AWS.

---

It based on ansible, which creates VMs using the specific API, and runs the deployment in it.

---

We enable customers to be able to do relevant tasks on their own. And get the full power out of the Cloud.

---

In the past half year one question raised…

---

What about

![Docker](img/dacker.jpg)

?

---

Basically you can run every OS you like to. Yet Windows.

---

### So. Yes!

--

Just install docker into the VM.

--

Sure. The containers run in VMs. But there is IMHO *no container vs. VM*, while VMs are one possible infrastructure for containers.

--

Did I mention, that you should keep your infrastructure as boring as possible?

--

Interresting infrastructure tends to fail in interresting ways!

---

Are there future plans to provide managed container services?

--

### Of course

---

But limited to man power!

http://www.syseleven.de/jobs/

--

In a first step, we will help you to get the orchestration layer up and running.

--

We help you with setting up monitoring.

--

We yet know what cantainers are. We know the tools and how to debug in the container world.

--

We will help you to get your deployment chains to work.

--

But that is not "managed conatainer services" at all!

---

We think about providing managed orchestration layers.

--

Like

![kubernetes](img/kubernetes.png)

--

… or Docker Swarm

![Docker Swarm](img/swarm.png)

--

We would manage and monitor all the services of the conductor.

![Conductor](img/dirigent.jpg)

--

We may manage additional services like a gitlab, jenkins or a private image registry.

--

The customer still is responsible all for the container workloads.

---

Maybe in a far

![Future](img/future.jpg)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/79909830@N04/<!-- .element: style="font-size: 50%" -->

Note:

Maybe in a far future…

--

We could provided managed services running in containers.
