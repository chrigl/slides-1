A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. Check out this live demo. Reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including nested slides, Markdown contents, PDF export, speaker notes and a JavaScript API. It's best viewed in a modern browser but fallbacks are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere. [see slides](reveal.js-3.0.0/)
